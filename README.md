# Wet snow classification 

This repository contains codes that make use of Sentinel-1 GRD data for classifying the wet snow. 
The processes are implemented in openEO.

In detail: 
* the notebook __wetsnow__ classifies a single Sentinel-1 image as wet snow by performing a simple thresholding on VV and VH ratios
